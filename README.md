# e-Paper  

Originally forked from the [waveshare/e-Paper repository](https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper).

This repository has been reduced to work with the [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/) [5.83'' e-Paper display](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/5.83inch_e-Paper_HAT) on a Raspberry Pi. Support for other display has been removed completely. Moreover it's meant to support only the C(++) programming language using the [bcm2835 library](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/) instaed of [Wiring Pi](http://wiringpi.com/).
